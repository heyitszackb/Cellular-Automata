# Cellular-Automata

Thanks for viewing my cellular automata project! This project handles a dynamic number of diseases and viruses. The controller can manipulate them with the "pen" tool that I've implemented to paint the viruses onto the screen. I've also implemented functionality to pause the simulation, step the simulation, erase specific cells, and increase/decrease the pen size.
